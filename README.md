AI FORGERY IMAGE DETECTION 
DESCRIPTION :
   This project is designed to detect the manipulated and forged images. In thi AI generation it is difficult to trust the social media and other platforms. 
   Many applications or sofwares can easily manipulate our images without our pictures from the social media. 
   So the system detects the manipulated images and tells with the evidence by which aspect the image is marked as manipulated.
   And also tells which type of forgery is made on the image which is more convinient to know what is done to the image

Programming Languages Used :
  -Python
Algorithms Used :
  -canny edge detection algorithm - (Edge visualization)
  -Error Level Analysis (ELA) Algorithm - (Splicing detection)
  -ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) - (Copy-move detection)
  -Local Binary Pattern (LBP) - (Noise analysis)
  -Threshold-Based Decision Algorithm - (Final decision)
  -CNN (convolutional neural networks) - (Detect complex and AI-generated image manipulations)
Purpose :
  This project is to detect whether an image is forged or authentic and to identify the type of forgery using a combination of classical image forensic techniques and deep learning, along with supporting evidence for explainability.
